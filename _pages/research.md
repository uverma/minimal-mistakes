Research Interests: Image Segmentation, Action Recognition

## Projects


1. Apparel recognition (consultancy project): The objective of this project is to develop an image classifier to recognize the different type of clothes (Shirt, T-Shirt, etc.) and its attributes. The state of the art image recognition algorithms such as CNN's (Inception, ResNet) along with image segmentation is being employed in this project. This is a consultancy project financed by Cleed, Paris, France.

2. Development of paper-based devices for fungal diagnosis: In this project, the microscopic fungal image is analyzed using image segmentation and recognition methods to identify the physiological and morphological characteristics of a fungus (_Candida Albicans_).  This interdisciplinary project (collaboration with experts from Microbiology (KMC) and Paper-based devices (MIT)) aims to develop a portable, low-cost fungal diagnostic device. This project is funded by Manipal McGill Center for Infectious Diseases (Center of Excellence established by Manipal University, India and McGill University, Montreal, Canada).
